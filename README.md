# lecture-notes
This repository contains my self-written lecture notes on mathematical methods for physics, developed as a structured companion to classical mechanics and theoretical physics courses. The notes aim to bridge the gap between formal mathematics and its applications in physical theories.

Contents

Calculus: differentiation, integration, multivariable calculus, and Taylor expansions.

Vector Analysis: gradient, divergence, curl, integral theorems (Green, Gauss, Stokes).

Complex Numbers: Euler’s formula, integration/differentiation, Fourier expansions.

Ordinary Differential Equations: first- and second-order ODEs, driven oscillations, and physical applications.

Calculus of Variations: derivation of Euler–Lagrange equations, applications to mechanics and conservation laws.

Linear Algebra: matrices, determinants, eigenvalue problems, and physical interpretations.
